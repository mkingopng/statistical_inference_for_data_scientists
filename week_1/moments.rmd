Apple is planning to host a live webcast of the next WWDC conference.
The server has a maximum capacity of 3 million people who can watch the
live webcast. Let random variable X denote the number of people
(measured in millions) that want to watch the live webcast, with pdf

$f(x) = x^2/9$ for 0 < x < 3
```{r}
f <- function(x) (x^2)/9
f
```
check that it integrates to 1
```{r}
area <- integrate(pdf, 0, 3)
area
```
the expected value is:
```{r}
f2 <- function(x) x * f(x)
e <- integrate(f2, 0, 3)
e
```
the something is ...
```{r}
f3  <- function(x) x^2 *f(x)
e2 <- integrate(f3, 0, 3)
e2
```
the variance is
```{r}
5.4 - 2.25^2
```
